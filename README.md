---

### Summary

It is possible to play *.wav and *.mp3 music  
It is a simple script, so functions such as `stop` `fast-forward` `counter` etc. are not  
but you can use it in your spare time.  
I will add them in my spare time.

### pip

You need to install the following libraries  

```
pip install playsound
```

### Import

```python
from playsound import playsound
```
